      description: Our program design is the combining structure of Golang and Python. There are three main files in our tool, which are portfolio.go, stockHandler.go, and web_interface.py. Additionally, out test cases are in portfolio_test.go. While portfolio.go and stockHandler.go are served as the back-end of the program, web_interface.py is the front-end. The motivation behind this project is to facilitate tracking and organizing an investment portfolio to equip the user with the most up to date information in order to make the best investment decisions. We were in need of tools like this since we started making investments and we thought it would be great to make one ourselves. The overall goal of this tool is to track a set of stock market positions for multiple portfolios, store the data, and display it using meaningful graphs and charts. In this tool, there are numbers of packages that are installed to support the program. For Golang, piquette/finance-go package is used to get access to the latest stock data.

      description: My motivation for doing this research project was to possibly discover a new treatment for diseases. I wanted to see how regenerative genes in jellyfish interacted with human proteins.  This type of research could potentially lead to ways that gene therapy could treat diseases.  Studying regenerative genes could potentially help with degenerative diseases.  Huntington’s disease and other degenerative diseases could be fixed with a breakthrough in this field of bioinformatics.  I first wanted to see what similar work was already being done in the field.  I looked at studies that talked about how jellyfish could regenerate structures in its body. I wanted to look for genes that were responsible for this function.  I found one study, The Sine oculis/Six class family of homeobox genes in jellyfish with and without eyes, development and eye regeneration, which talked about how different gene expressions can cause different types of cell growth. I decided that I would be focusing on the findings of the one study, Regenerative Capacity of the Upside-down Jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana. (NCBI)  This research article found the gene they found responsible for regeneration in the cells in one type of jellyfish.  A couple of types of genes were identified in the study to be linked to the different types of cell regeneration in jellyfish.  A link to Genbank was provided in the study to the protein sequence.

      description: My interest area of research is studying crypto currency market transactions.  I would like to see the different factors that contribute to market volatility.  Using the Cardano Plutus playground, you are able to write applications that interact with the blockchain.   My goal is to create an application that will help me understand how the Cardano blockchain works.  I would like to know more about how the blockchain functions and how the hash is identified.  Cardano has a large variety of builder tools on their development website.  I want to look into using some of these tools to study the transactions more closely. I want to take a look at the different processes that take place behind the scenes.  I believe that doing so will help me gain a better understanding of how the Cardano blockchain interacts with each other.  Using the transaction’s metadata I can look at how Cardano stores information and authenticates the data.  This will also help me in studying the market trends Cardano.  I will be able to see when the market is trading and high trading volume times.  Taking a look at these different factors helps me better understand when the market goes up and down.  I would also like to possibly create my own cryptocurrency to use and test.  Cardano allows you to create your own coin using the ADA blockchain.  Daedalus wallet is also something that I will have to look into because the ADA coin uses that wallet.  I hope to learn more about how crypto works and how transactions affect the market.

      description:  During my research I found a extreme lack of knowledge on how to use the blockchain sustainably. Many people have tried to address the energy issues the cryptocurrencies have but it have proven not successful.  I took a look at multiple different studies.  I found four that talked about ways that have already been attempted.  There was also a study talking about how the different crypto currencies use different amounts of energy based on how their blockchain network is set up.  I would like to take a look at how others have failed in the past and work to find better approaches.  I believe that studying this will help to develop a new way to use the blockchain.  With my research, I would like to create a way to use the blockchain consuming the least amount of energy.  Something that would be great to find is a way to cost effectively use the blockchain by consuming the least amount of electricity.  Attempts in the past have not been able to overcome the challenge of accumulating large amounts of transactions fees.  I would like to find a way around this in my research and continue on looking for new ways to do this.

    - name: Feasibility
      image: 'images/portfolio/Feasibility.png'
      description:  To conduct my research, many factors need to be considered for its feasibility.  Creating a cryptocurrency requires the use of software and hardware. Some of the hardware equipment that would be necessary would be a server.  This could be something that I would have to build on my own.  This would be rather expensive to do.  There is also the option of paying people to host the server.  While less expensive, I would have less access to the blockchain ledgers.  This is something that I would have to weigh the pros and cons for. A software tool that I will have to familiarize my self with is the plutus playground tool.  With this tool I will be able to interact with the blockchain.  I will also be able to create policies that the blockchain will operate on.  Another tool is learning how the cardano node tool works.  Installing it is nessasary for creating a node.  The final tool that I will need to look into is the Marlowe tool that allows me to create contracts on the blockchain.  This will be what I conduct my research with. Hopefully if everything goes well I will have a fully functioning blockchain that I created through the cardano network.  If I do get it working, I would be able to test it by sending and receiving transactions.  This would be the bench mark for it working.  Another thing thing would be if I am able to mint and burn tokens.

    - name: Prototype  
      image: 'images/portfolio/prototype.png'
      description: For this project, I created a prototype for a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.  I was able to accomplish this by learning a little bit about a language called Solidity.  Using this language I was able to write a token that is able to mint, burn, and conduct transactions.  I based my token on the ERC20 standard for crypto since this was just a basic test to see how hard it was to create a token.  With ERC20, this allowed me to see the total supply, balance of, transfer, and transfer from.  I was able to import the basic library for the standard.  From there I had to write the token script and tweak some other code for it to work.  After I was done creating the prototype, I had something that worked like a basic cryptocurrency.  I was able to mint coins for wallets and burn them.  I also was able to send coins between wallets.  Creating this made me learn and understand how the blockchain works on a lower level.  In the future, I would like to keep exploring the different ways to set up a blockchain.  This is a good starting point however,  I would like to still keep my options open and possible change networks.

    - name: Experiment  
      image: 'images/portfolio/Gcoin.png'
      description: For my experiment, I wanted to take a look at making a unique token on the blockchain.   I wanted to do this through a proof of history system.  I originally had my prototype crypto through Etherium.  After learning more about the different pros and cons of each system, I eventually decided to switch networks.  I switched to Solana because it allowed me to more easily create a POH contract on their blockchain.  It also has the added benefit of handing transactions faster and cheaper due to the lattice network configuration.  Creating the smart contract for my token required me to set up a dedicated server to run my contract from.  While most of the code for the token is stored there, Solana also conducts the transaction through their network.  This can then be tracked through the white pages of Solana.  With this, I am able to see how much each wallet has stored in it and what percentage of the market they hold.  Currently, my crypto is fully operational and transactions can be conducted using it like any other token.  The policy that I minted allows me to mint more tokens at any given time.

    - name: Research Proposal 
      image: 'images/portfolio/Gcoin.png'
      description: For my research project, I would like to conduct a study that looks at different factors that cause market fluctuations for crypto.  I specifically want to look at how blockchain activity affects it.  By having a deeper understanding of a factor that causes change to the crypto price, it is possible to start to predict market trends.  This would be beneficial because it would almost be like looking to the future when buying and selling crypto.  I would also like to look at how the volume traded affects the price of the coin.  This can help show if large transactions are being conducted on the network or if something is just being propped up by bots.  This will also lead to ways to show if a crypto coin is trustworthy and not just a rug pull.  Researching this will hopefully help lead to ways to look at the market activity and determine if it is a worthwhile investment.  I would like to further this technology by working with the blockchain to understand different influences better.  The motivation for doing this project was because I wanted to take a deeper look at what factors go into a cryptocurrency.  By taking a deeper look into everything that contributes to market fluctuation you can gain a better understanding of market trends.  This is something that is an emerging field.  Cryptocurrency is a new technology that has yet to be utilized to its full potential.  The amount of studies on this topic is still relatively concentrated due to it being an emerging technology.  I also wanted to do something that was fairly cutting-edge.  I wanted to do this to challenge myself to do something new.  Something that has never been done before.  I thought that something like this would keep me interested in a project.  For years I have been interested in crypto.  I have followed it since around 2011.  I even mined Bitcoin back in the day.  It is a topic that I feel that I am uniquely qualified to research due to my past experiences.  I wanted my research project to tie into it somehow.  I decided that I would focus my project on factors of the market.  This includes things like transactional data from users sending and receiving tokens being verified on the network.  I hope to be able to understand and develop new ways of predicting market fluctuations for cryptocurrency.  The research gap that this address is the number of studies conducted on transactional data looking at market activity.  Since this is such an emerging field, the research is really just not there yet.  It still has yet to be done and is currently something that more and more people are starting to study.   They are starting to realize that there are factors that go into the fluctuation of the market price.  By studying, these people can predict the optimal time when to buy and sell crypto.  This would obviously have monetary benefits from this.  The research would be beneficial to the field because it is something that really hasn’t been researched yet.  From my research, I was only able to find studies taking a look at different environmental impacts that different contracts have and the different factors.  Others wanted to take a look at trying to predict market fluctuations with machine learning.   All other studies from my research did not take into account multiple factors.   I would like to address this in my research.  I want to take into consideration multiple factors to research so that hopefully I can accurately predict changes.  For my preliminary research project, I wanted to create a Proof of the history of cryptocurrency so that I can test transactional data.  I decided to do this because it would allow me to have a test environment to conduct experiments. I decided that I wanted to use proof of history due to a couple of factors.  The first one is that it is a lot more eco-friendly than proof of work coins such as Bitcoin.  The fact that it is not bottlenecked by servers, also makes it much faster than traditional methods.  The second is it is theoretically more secure than most other contracts due to everyone being able to independently verify transactions. The token, being proof of history, does not require it to be verified on a server. The cuts down on the required hardware needed to support this network.  It makes having something like this a lot more feasible. The first thing that created for my prototype was to create a wallet for my token. When this wallet is created I need to mint a specified amount of coins that are allowed for that contract. This is mining all of the currency in circulation.  The wallet that I have created for my experiment is hosted on a private virtual machine that costs money to maintain. After a coin has been, minted it will need to be sent to a receiving address. Once the coin has been verified and successfully sent through the blockchain’s network, it is time to verify it on the white pages.  This maintains a database of all of the transactions of a coin to confirm that the coin really exists. The white pages will provide the entire history of the coin to keep a record of what coins exist or have been burned. This will allow me to confirm the coin is fully operational and able to conduct real-world transactions that are able to be studied.  My prototype project resulted in a functioning token that can be bought and sold as any other cryptocurrency could.  The data my research produced is a functional blockchain wallet that can be used to study transactional data.  The wallet is what accounts use to hold, send and receive tokens.  This is important for having things being tracked on the white pages.  By viewing the white pages, it is possible to tell if the transactions successfully went through the blockchain network.  This is something that the network uses to keep track of previous transactions of a token. The result of my experiments was a token that successfully tracks on the white pages of the blockchain network.  This allows me to inspect transaction data from verified transactions.  On the website to check the transactions, you are able to see the accounts being created for the token.  This also tracks amounts sent and received from users’ wallets.  You are able to see the breakdown of who holds the coins too.  It breaks down every wallet that holds your token and what percentage of the pool they own.  This will be important when later looking at the size of the transactions sent and received by users.  Everything is stored and remembered for verification so that data can be studied.  This is something that will be useful in my future for my research because it shows that it is possible to study transactional data from a cryptocurrency.  Through this research, I did encounter a few problems when developing my prototype.  A challenge that I encountered was that I had to remake my entire cryptocurrency during the prototype stage.  This was because I wanted to change my coin’s contract to a proof of work system.  The change was necessary due to the network structure and what was required to host a node.  I wanted it to be a proof of history token and not proof of work.  I originally made a basic cryptocurrency through the Ethereum network as it is something that is widely supported.  While the Ethereum network is fairly easy to work with, it did not seem like the right fit for my project.  This made me have to start from scratch.  Restarting also caused me to have to wait and get verified on the new network so I could not continue until that was finished. Another issue that caused me problems what that I had to create my VM on a dedicated server for my token.  I choose to do this because running it locally would create issues such as it not always being up.  This would also cause a loss of information on the database which is something that I do not want when conducting research. After creating my server, I also came across the issue of being unable to connect to it.  While I was connecting to it as the online documentation said, I was refusing my connection.  I was only on a hotspot that I was able to connect.  This is something that I and going to have to look into in the future because not being able to connect to the token’s network will prevent me from conducting research in the future. While I have gotten it to work for my prototype, I might have to make changes to my firewall or allow the connection to be established over my internet connection.  Ethical considerations for this project would have to be using this technology for monetary gains.  This would have to be something that I would have to address if my research is successful.  Since something like this would have an influence on the market, it could cause market externalities.  This is obviously something that I would like to avoid.  Since this is something that only happens if my research produced something worked, I will cross that bridge when I get there.  There is also the consideration that people do not like their wallet addresses being stored and tracked.  While this is all public information, people do not like their data being stored.  I would have to make it clear that the project that I am working on is clearly for research purposes.  To address this issue,  I would have to make sure that information is securely stored on a local drive.  This would ensure that the data that I am collecting is only able to be accessed by me.  The final ethical consideration for the project would users of my crypto network are technically using something with real monetary value.  This means that money can be put into the network and taken out.  With this in mind, it is possible that if someone purchased a large number of tokens and I sold all of my coin that I hold on to, it would be like stealing money.  To fix this problem, I will have to maintain the size of the contract so that it is not just a scam.  I will just have to burn coins to maintain the value of the coin.  Continuing this project in the future, I would like to start working on something that tracks other cryptocurrency’s transactional data.  This would allow me to compare and contrast with the coin that I have made.  I would likely have to make a web scraping script to pull the information off of the white pages.  A python script would probably need to be created to accomplish this.  It is important because this would allow me to gather something that I can study and gain information on.  It will be vital to my research to have something that users are actually conducting transactions on.  I can study the times of most market activity and the size of the transactions.  Another thing that I must consider making in the future is a database to store all the information that I am collecting.  I will need to do this so that I have a way to manage the data.  Without this, I cannot use the data to study and it would be meaningless.  I will have to consider the pros and cons of different database management systems.   Something that would provide easy data manipulation would be preferable for my research.  This will make making graphs and displaying the data much more user-friendly.  From all of this,  I would like to find a way to determine the future of market fluctuations.  I hope that my research will provide answers as to why this happens.  I want to study something that benefits this field so that it can be understood better.
