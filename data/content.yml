  title: 'HELLO THERE'
  content: My interests include working with Cryptocurrency and studying their market trends.  I would like to focus my research on studying how the blockchain works.  By doing this I hope to learn more about how transactions affect the market price of ADA.  I hope to learn more about this using the Cardano network by studying it. If you have any questions feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn, Github, or by email](#contact)!

      description: Our program design is the combining structure of Golang and Python. There are three main files in our tool, which are portfolio.go, stockHandler.go, and web_interface.py. Additionally, out test cases are in portfolio_test.go. While portfolio.go and stockHandler.go are served as the back-end of the program, web_interface.py is the front-end. The motivation behind this project is to facilitate tracking and organizing an investment portfolio to equip the user with the most up to date information in order to make the best investment decisions. We were in need of tools like this since we started making investments and we thought it would be great to make one ourselves. The overall goal of this tool is to track a set of stock market positions for multiple portfolios, store the data, and display it using meaningful graphs and charts. In this tool, there are numbers of packages that are installed to support the program. For Golang, piquette/finance-go package is used to get access to the latest stock data.

      description: My motivation for doing this research project was to possibly discover a new treatment for diseases. I wanted to see how regenerative genes in jellyfish interacted with human proteins.  This type of research could potentially lead to ways that gene therapy could treat diseases.  Studying regenerative genes could potentially help with degenerative diseases.  Huntington’s disease and other degenerative diseases could be fixed with a breakthrough in this field of bioinformatics.  I first wanted to see what similar work was already being done in the field.  I looked at studies that talked about how jellyfish could regenerate structures in its body. I wanted to look for genes that were responsible for this function.  I found one study, The Sine oculis/Six class family of homeobox genes in jellyfish with and without eyes, development and eye regeneration, which talked about how different gene expressions can cause different types of cell growth. I decided that I would be focusing on the findings of the one study, Regenerative Capacity of the Upside-down Jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana. (NCBI)  This research article found the gene they found responsible for regeneration in the cells in one type of jellyfish.  A couple of types of genes were identified in the study to be linked to the different types of cell regeneration in jellyfish.  A link to Genbank was provided in the study to the protein sequence.

      description: My interest area of research is studying crypto currency market transactions.  I would like to see the different factors that contribute to market volatility.  Using the Cardano Plutus playground, you are able to write applications that interact with the blockchain.   My goal is to create an application that will help me understand how the Cardano blockchain works.  I would like to know more about how the blockchain functions and how the hash is identified.  Cardano has a large variety of builder tools on their development website.  I want to look into using some of these tools to study the transactions more closely. I want to take a look at the different processes that take place behind the scenes.  I believe that doing so will help me gain a better understanding of how the Cardano blockchain interacts with each other.  Using the transaction’s metadata I can look at how Cardano stores information and authenticates the data.  This will also help me in studying the market trends Cardano.  I will be able to see when the market is trading and high trading volume times.  Taking a look at these different factors helps me better understand when the market goes up and down.  I would also like to possibly create my own cryptocurrency to use and test.  Cardano allows you to create your own coin using the ADA blockchain.  Daedalus wallet is also something that I will have to look into because the ADA coin uses that wallet.  I hope to learn more about how crypto works and how transactions affect the market.
