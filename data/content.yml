      description: Our program design is the combining structure of Golang and Python. There are three main files in our tool, which are portfolio.go, stockHandler.go, and web_interface.py. Additionally, out test cases are in portfolio_test.go. While portfolio.go and stockHandler.go are served as the back-end of the program, web_interface.py is the front-end. The motivation behind this project is to facilitate tracking and organizing an investment portfolio to equip the user with the most up to date information in order to make the best investment decisions. We were in need of tools like this since we started making investments and we thought it would be great to make one ourselves. The overall goal of this tool is to track a set of stock market positions for multiple portfolios, store the data, and display it using meaningful graphs and charts. In this tool, there are numbers of packages that are installed to support the program. For Golang, piquette/finance-go package is used to get access to the latest stock data.

      description: My motivation for doing this research project was to possibly discover a new treatment for diseases. I wanted to see how regenerative genes in jellyfish interacted with human proteins.  This type of research could potentially lead to ways that gene therapy could treat diseases.  Studying regenerative genes could potentially help with degenerative diseases.  Huntingtonâ€™s disease and other degenerative diseases could be fixed with a breakthrough in this field of bioinformatics.  I first wanted to see what similar work was already being done in the field.  I looked at studies that talked about how jellyfish could regenerate structures in its body. I wanted to look for genes that were responsible for this function.  I found one study, The Sine oculis/Six class family of homeobox genes in jellyfish with and without eyes, development and eye regeneration, which talked about how different gene expressions can cause different types of cell growth. I decided that I would be focusing on the findings of the one study, Regenerative Capacity of the Upside-down Jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana. (NCBI)  This research article found the gene they found responsible for regeneration in the cells in one type of jellyfish.  A couple of types of genes were identified in the study to be linked to the different types of cell regeneration in jellyfish.  A link to Genbank was provided in the study to the protein sequence.
